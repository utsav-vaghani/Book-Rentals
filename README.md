# Book-Rentals

## What it does?
Once the user logged-in user can take a book on rent and also put a book on rent so that one can use it.


## Motivation
Sometimes we read a book only once after that we do not require it. so we can give to someone so that one can read it and also we can make a profit from it ;).
